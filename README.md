# Fincat

Fincat is a personal, local-first financial research assistant. The long-term
goal is to load and maintain a universe of U.S. equities, enrich that universe
with fundamentals and earnings data, and then let you "talk to" that data using
natural language.

Instead of manually writing screeners or SQL queries, you describe what you are
looking for (in plain English), and Fincat:

- figures out which data sources and tools to call,
- runs the necessary filters and computations over your local dataset, and
- responds with a concise, explainable answer you can refine interactively.

## Universe and data scope

- **Universe**: U.S. equities defined by the curated symbol universe in
  `data/symbols` (generated by Fincat's own data-fetching tools).
- **Primary data sources** (current and planned):
  - Symbol metadata (name, sector, industry, etc.).
  - Earnings data: upcoming earnings dates, recent earnings events, EPS
    estimates and surprises.
  - Price and valuation data: current price, simple valuation ratios such as P/E
    and, later, forward P/E or related metrics.
  - Additional financial statement data (revenue, net income, leverage, etc.) is
    a stretch goal for the future.

The focus is **lightweight, personal analysis**, not institution-grade data
coverage or latency.

## What you should be able to ask

The vision is that you can ask questions like:

- "What companies have earnings in the next 2 weeks?"
- "Show me earnings data for a handful of symbols in the financial sector."
- "Filter to companies with a P/E greater than 10, where the estimated earnings
  look reasonable relative to that P/E."
- "Within the current universe, highlight names where upcoming earnings and
  simple valuation metrics line up in an interesting way."

Initially, Fincat should be able to **filter and list** matching companies, and
optionally explain *why* each one appears in the results (for example, by
showing the relevant earnings dates, estimates, and simple valuation metrics).
A longer-term goal is to make this **interactive**, so you can refine the
results in conversation:

- Ask a broad screening question.
- See an initial list of matches.
- Add or tweak constraints (sector, market cap, valuation bands, etc.).
- Drill into individual names for more detail.

## Storage and computation model

Because this is designed as a local, personal tool, the underlying computation
should be simple to stand up and operate:

- Use a **local analytics engine** (likely SQLite or DuckDB) to store and query
  the enriched universe from `data/symbols` plus earnings and fundamentals.
- Keep the dataset modest in size (tens of thousands of symbols with a
  reasonable history of earnings and key metrics), optimized for exploratory
  analysis rather than huge-scale backtesting.
- Let the LLM-based agent orchestrate *what* to query and *how* to explain the
  results, but let the database/analytics layer do the heavy numeric lifting.

## LLM and tooling orchestration

Fincat uses an LLM-powered agent as a **planner and explainer** on top of a
set of concrete tools and data providers. The rough division of responsibility
is:

- **Data layer** (providers + local DB): knows how to load, refresh, and query
  symbols, sectors, earnings, and valuation metrics.
- **Orchestration layer** (agent): decides which tools to call and in what
  order to satisfy a natural-language request (for example: find sectors,
  choose symbols from a sector, fetch earnings, fetch basic company details,
  then construct a response).
- **LLM**: interprets user intent, chooses or fills in parameters for tools,
  and turns structured results into clear, concise natural-language answers.

Over time, the orchestration logic may evolve into higher-level "tasks" such as
"sector_earnings" or "valuation_screen", which can internally:

1. Select a set of symbols from the universe (by sector, index, or other
   criteria).
2. Pull in the necessary earnings and fundamentals for those symbols.
3. Apply user-specified filters (date windows, P/E thresholds, etc.).
4. Hand the final dataset to the LLM for explanation and refinement.

## Non-goals

Fincat is intentionally scoped as a **personal research tool**, not a
production trading or signal-generation system. In particular, it does **not**
aim to:

- Provide trading signals or alpha models.
- Support low-latency intraday trading or execution.
- Guarantee complete data coverage, regulatory compliance, or suitability for
  institutional reporting.

The priority is to make it easy for a single user to explore and reason about a
local dataset of U.S. equities using natural language, while keeping the
architecture simple and maintainable.
